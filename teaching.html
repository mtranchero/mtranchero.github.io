                    This course provides an integrated strategy framework for innovation-based entrepreneurs. Some first-time founders believe that
                    entrepreneurs need to “just do it” and that there is little role for strategy. Over time, however, most founders realize what
                    experienced entrepreneurs and investors already know: two equally capable companies with very similar ideas and founded at 
                    the same time can have dramatically different outcomes. One creates millions of dollars in value while the other fails completely.
                    The difference? Strikingly different strategy. In the first module, the class covers four key strategic choices that shape when 
                    and how startups deliver real value to their stakeholders. The second module explains how such choices can be organized into 4 
                    different strategic “playbooks” to systematically evaluate alternate strategies for a startup. The third module consists in the
                    application of this framework to a real startup and a debrief with the founder. This class has the goal to transform each student
                    from someone with a vague understanding of the role of strategy in entrepreneurship to a master of strategic thinking in a 
                    startup environment. Syllabus available upon request.

                    This course is about the art and science of influence in organizations. Many people are ambivalent, if not disdainful,
                    of those who seek to wield power and influence at work. Yet organizations are fundamentally political entities, and 
                    the ability to diagnose and navigate organizational politics is critical for personal and organizational success. 
                    All aspiring leaders therefore stand to benefit from developing greater political acumen.  Although it is tempting 
                    to think that people are either naturally skilled in the exercise of power or not, the reality is that political 
                    skills can be learned. They are, however, difficult to acquire through passive learning alone—for example, reading 
                    articles or listening to lectures. These skills are more readily developed through a combination of deep personal 
                    reflection, application of concepts to real-world situations, and having opportunities to practice and receive 
                    feedback from others on new interpersonal styles and approaches. The interactive and simulation-based design of 
                    this course reflects these learning principles. Syllabus available upon request.

                    The purpose of Strategy is to enable students to design profitable strategies that are responsive to the characteristics 
                    of the firm and the nature of competition in the relevant market. The class is designed around three key questions: How 
                    can firms balance the opportunities and risks associated with dynamic markets and uncertain technological changes? How 
                    can a company generate value, and how can it capture that value as profit leveraging its core capabilities? How does 
                    the external environment of the firm affect the optimal internal organization of the firm? This course is part of the
                    first year MBA core. Some of the topics covered include forms of competitive advantage, Make vs Buy, corporate
                    venture, resources, market entry, and network effects. Syllabus available upon request.

                    BEE’s goal is to increase representation in economics by dismantling barriers to participation in our field and confronting bias. 
                    Making economics more inclusive requires building new educational pipelines that facilitate participation of a broader and more 
                    diverse population. As part of this goal, BEE organizes every spring a tutoring program that matches graduate students with underrepresented
                    undergraduate students in economics (both female students and students of color). As part of this program, I have been a mentor for 
                    Econ140, the econometrics class for undergraduate students in economics.

                    The Undergraduate Research Apprentice Program (URAP) provides an opportunity for Berkeley undergraduates to work with faculty
                    members on cutting-edge research projects. Working closely with mentors, students deepen their knowledge and skills in areas of
                    special interest, while experiencing what it means to be part of an intellectual community engaged in research. The program is
                    designed to stimulate awareness of advanced research and interest in graduate study. Students earns up to 4 units of academic 
                    credit for their research work. As part of this program, I have mentored four undergraduate students.
