                <p>This paper argues that mixed-methods triangulation can be understood as the manifestation 
                  of retroduction, the logic of inference espoused by critical realism. As such, it can provide 
                  the basis upon which different insights upon the same phenomenon can be sensibly combined and 
                  thus has the potential to unite aspects of different traditions of economic and social thought. 
                  In this regard, the paper supports Lawson's view that the exclusive insistence on mathematical 
                  and statistical modelling in economics is misguided. The paper explores how disciplinary 
                  boundaries may be broken down and interdisciplinary social science, of which economics 
                  can be a part, established.</p>
