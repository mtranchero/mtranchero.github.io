                <p>The heart of corporate strategy is risky decisions making in dynamic environments. Scholars have suggested 
                  that good strategies come from theories that predict the outcomes of actions from logical reasoning. 
                  However, the recent explosion of data-driven opportunities seems to challenge this theory view of strategy. 
                  In this paper, I argue that data do not replace theory, but rather increase its value. In settings where 
                  testing all data-driven leads is too costly, firms can separate diamonds from the rough by exploiting 
                  their theoretical understandings to rule out false positives. I investigate this idea in the context of 
                  pharmaceutical innovation, exploiting the unique characteristics of genome-wide association studies. 
                  I also develop a new measurement approach that overcomes some limitations of patent-to-paper citations. 
                  My results show that data-driven signals lead pharmaceutical firms to commit considerable resources to 
                  new targets, but around a third of total investments pertain to false positive leads. Confirming my priors, 
                  it is firms with no previous theoretical knowledge of genetic biology that fall in the trap of false positives. 
                  Taken together, my study shows that the data revolution is reshaping strategic decisions but might lead to 
                  chasing suboptimal leads. To achieve competitive advantage in the age of big data, data-driven opportunities 
                  are a complement rather than a substitute to the theoretical understanding of causal mechanisms.</p>

                <p>How does the growing availability of data shape innovation? I propose that data analytics enables a new way to 
                  search for novel combinations among technological components. Recombinant search is usually tethered by past 
                  attempts or theoretical priors. Instead, inventors can use data to extract signals of what combinations are 
                  more promising for follow-on experimentation across the entire landscape. I investigate this emerging phenomenon 
                  in the context of human genomics, where genome-wide association studies (GWASs) approximate the ideal of a 
                  data-driven search for the genetic roots of diseases. My results show that novel gene-disease associations 
                  introduced by GWASs span a vast portion of the genetic landscape, are likely to involve neglected human genes,
                  and are of higher scientific value than comparable associations introduced by targeted studies. The latter 
                  result is stronger for genes difficult to study experimentally but becomes negative for already well known genes. 
                  Taken together, these findings point to the potential and boundary conditions of data-driven search strategies 
                  in technological innovation.</p>

                <p>The increasingly empirical nature of economics research has spurred concerns that researchers might pursue less impactful 
                  projects purely motivated by convenient access to data. To shed light on this topic, we study the impact of confidential
                  administrative data from the U.S. Census Bureau on the rate and direction of economics research. Exploiting the progressive
                  geographic expansion of U.S. Census Bureau's Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (FSRDCs), we estimate the impact of 
                  local data access on individual researchers' scientific output. We find that increased access to administrative microdata 
                  helps rather than hurts knowledge production, leading empirical researchers to publish a greater number of higher-impact 
                  papers. Importantly, local access to FSRDCs has significant spillovers also on economists that do not directly use them. 
                  We provide suggestive evidence that exposure to research carried out in FSRDCs explains this finding by leading researchers
                  to explore new topics and adopt better research designs. Our results point to the promise of administrative data to enable 
                  important scientific advances with potentially large impacts on policy.</p>

                <p>We consider settings such as innovation-oriented R\&D and entrepreneurship where agents must explore across different
                  projects with varying but uncertain payoffs. How does providing partial data on project payoffs affect individual 
                  performance and social welfare? While data can typically reduce uncertainty and improve welfare, we present a simple 
                  theoretical framework where data provision can decrease group and individual payoffs. We predict that when data
                  shines a light on sufficiently attractive (but not optimal) projects, it can crowd-out exploration activity, lowering
                  individual and group payoffs as compared to when no data is provided. We test our theory in an online lab experiment 
                  and show that data provision on the true value of one project can hurt individual payoffs by 12% and reduce the group's
                  likelihood of discovering the optimal outcome by 48%. Our results provide a theoretical and empirical examination of 
                  the streetlight effect, outlining the conditions under which data leads agents to look under the lamppost rather than 
                  engage in socially beneficial exploration.</p>

                <p>This paper argues that mixed-methods triangulation can be understood as the manifestation 
                  of retroduction, the logic of inference espoused by critical realism. As such, it can provide

                  In this regard, the paper supports Lawson's view that the exclusive insistence on mathematical

                  <p>This paper argues that mixed-methods triangulation can be understood as the manifestation 
                    of retroduction, the logic of inference espoused by critical realism. As such, it can provide 
                    the basis upon which different insights upon the same phenomenon can be sensibly combined and 
                    thus has the potential to unite aspects of different traditions of economic and social thought. 
                    In this regard, the paper supports Lawson's view that the exclusive insistence on mathematical 
                    and statistical modelling in economics is misguided. The paper explores how disciplinary 
                    boundaries may be broken down and interdisciplinary social science, of which economics 
                    can be a part, established.</p>
