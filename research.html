                <p> Big data are increasingly used to make predictions about the value of uncertain investments, thereby helping firms identify 
                  innovation opportunities without the need for domain knowledge. This trend has raised questions about which firms will primarily 
                  benefit from the availability of these data-driven predictions. Contrary to existing research suggesting that data-driven 
                  predictions level the playing field for firms lacking domain knowledge, I argue — using a simple theoretical framework — that these 
                  predictions reinforce the competitive advantage of firms with domain knowledge. In high-stakes contexts like innovation, where 
                  returns are skewed and only a few leads can be pursued, domain knowledge helps evaluate predictions and avoid false positives. 
                  I test this idea using novel data on the pharmaceutical industry, exploiting the features of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
                  that provide data-driven predictions about new drug targets. The results show that GWAS stimulate corporate investments in 
                  innovation, yet around one-third of these efforts are misallocated toward false positive predictions. Companies lacking domain 
                  knowledge react more strongly but are disproportionally likely to fall into the trap of false positives. Instead, domain knowledge 
                  helps firms pursue fewer alternatives that are more likely to be the best opportunities. Together, the results show that even if 
                  data-driven predictions are valuable in innovation, domain knowledge remains a crucial source of competitive advantage in the 
                  age of big data technologies.</p>

                <p>How does big data change the search for innovation? Data-driven predictions can identify promising technological combinations even when 
                  their underlying mechanisms are unknown. This has raised concerns that decoupling innovation from theoretical understanding weakens 
                  incentives to develop new theory and results in discoveries whose consequences are poorly understood. Using an evolutionary framework 
                  of variation and selection, I argue that data technologies can, instead, reinforce theory generation. Data-driven search broadens the 
                  space of combinations explored and increases the variability in outcomes compared to theory-driven approaches. As a result, this search 
                  strategy uncovers more surprising findings that stimulate, rather than substitute, new theorizing. I test these ideas in the domain of 
                  human genetics, where genome-wide association studies (GWAS) represent a data-driven search for the genetic roots of disease. Compared 
                  to traditional theory-based approaches, GWAS introduce gene-disease combinations that span a wider portion of the genetic landscape, 
                  more frequently fall at both extremes of scientific quality, and often defy expectations from existing knowledge. Rather than crowding 
                  out theory, GWAS findings trigger a surge of follow-on work aimed at elucidating their causal mechanisms. Together, the results reveal a 
                  complementarity between theory and data in search, suggesting that big data technologies can fuel virtuous cycles of theorizing sparked 
                  by empirical anomalies.</p>

                <p> Large Language Models (LLMs) are proving to be a powerful toolkit for management and organizational 
                  research. While early work has largely focused on the value of these tools for data processing and 
                  replicating survey-based research, the potential of LLMs for theory building is yet to be recognized.
                  We argue that LLMs can accelerate the pace at which researchers can develop, validate, and extend 
                  strategic management theory. We propose a novel framework called Generative AI-Based Experimentation
                  (GABE) that enables researchers to conduct exploratory in silico experiments that can mirror the
                  complexities of real-world organizational settings, featuring multiple agents and strategic
                  interdependencies. This approach is unique because it allows researchers to unpack the mechanisms 
                  behind results by directly modifying agents' roles, preferences, and capabilities, and asking them 
                  to reveal the explanations behind decisions. We apply this framework to a novel theory studying 
                  strategic exploration under uncertainty. We show how our framework can not only replicate the results 
                  from experiments with human subjects at a much lower cost, but can also be used to extend theory by 
                  clarifying boundary conditions and uncovering mechanisms. We conclude that LLMs possess tremendous 
                  potential to complement existing methods for theorizing in strategy and, more broadly, the social sciences.

                <p>We study exploration under uncertainty and show how access to data on past attempts can paradoxically hinder breakthrough 
                  discovery. We develop a model of the "streetlight effect" demonstrating that when data highlights attractive but ultimately 
                  suboptimal projects, it can narrow exploration and suppress innovation. In a laboratory experiment, we find that revealing 
                  the value of an enticing project lowers payoffs and reduces breakthrough discoveries. This drop stems from increased 
                  free-riding behavior, which crowds out the generation of new data. We validate our theory in the context of scientific 
                  research into the genetic origins of human diseases. To identify the causal impact of past data, we use an instrumental
                  variable that leverages exogenous genetic overlaps between humans and laboratory mice, which reduces research costs for 
                  specific genes and leads to prioritized data collection about them. We find that diseases with early evidence of promising 
                  genetic targets are 16 percentage points less likely to yield breakthroughs than those where early efforts failed. 
                  While competition attenuates the streetlight effect, it does not eliminate it. Our paper provides the first systematic 
                  analysis of this phenomenon, outlining the conditions under which data leads agents to look under the lamppost rather than 
                  engage in socially beneficial exploration.</p>

                  To study this question, we exploit the progressive geographic expansion of the U.S. Census Bureau's Federal Statistical Research Data Centers 
                  (FSRDCs). FSRDCs boost data diffusion, help empirical researchers publish more articles in top outlets, and increase citation-weighted 
                  publications. Besides direct data usage, spillovers to non-adopters also drive this effect. Further, citations to exposed researchers 
                  in policy documents increase significantly. Our findings underscore the importance of data access for scientific progress and evidence-based

                <p>We develop a model of how a principal motivates innovation by contracting researchers to generate ideas that improve economic 
                  productivity. Because individual contributions are unobservable, the principal relies on career incentives tied to peer 
                  recognition, measured through citations. However, citations reward not only societal value but also reflect the number of 
                  researchers working on a given topic. As a result, researchers may inefficiently over-coordinate their efforts. This can give 
                  rise to “academic bubbles" in which researchers continue working in areas with little prospect of advancing knowledge. 
                  We empirically analyze the selection of topics in research on the genetic determinants of human disease. We document that crowding 
                  on a narrow set of topics inflates citation impact, with patterns that point to career concerns as a driver of misallocated

                <p>Microdata from government agencies is believed to be valuable for economics research, and yet access to this data is highly 
                  restricted due to concerns about privacy and security. We provide an empirical assessment of the use and impact of 
                  restricted-access data that researchers can analyze at the U.S. Census Bureau's secure facilities. Our findings show 
                  that the use of Census Bureau's confidential data is growing and the publications employing it have a higher impact on 
                  the scientific and policy debate. However, adoption remains largely limited to established researchers from prestigious 
                  institutions. Our results and discussion inform the design of policies that balance privacy protection with accessibility
                  to confidential microdata.</p>

                    <p>The distinction between macro- and microinventions is at the core of recent debates on the Industrial Revolution. 
                      Yet, the empirical testing of this notion has remained elusive. We address this issue by introducing a new quality 
                      indicator for all patents granted in England in the period 1700–1850. The indicator provides the opportunity for a 
                      large-scale empirical appraisal of macro- and microinventions. Our findings indicate that macroinventions did not 
                      exhibit any specific time-clustering, while microinventions were characterized by clustering behavior. In addition, 
                      we also find that macroinventions displayed a labor-saving bias and were mostly introduced by professional engineers.
                      These results suggest that Allen’s and Mokyr’s views of macroinventions, rather than conflicting, should be 
                      regarded as complementary.</p>

                    <p>In this chapter we discuss the role of natural resources and endowment structures on structural
                      change. Departing from theories of trade that stress specialization according to one’s comparative
                      advantages as the key route to development, we articulate an alternative point of view on the
                      role of technological learning and absolute advantages for structural transformation. Ricardian
                      adjustment processes relying on endowment-based comparative advantages are often times a misleading 
                      driver of development; rather, technological competitiveness offers a better criterion to achieve sustained 
                      economic well-being. This theoretical perspective provides useful guidance to interpret the effects
                      of globalization and the role of natural resources relative to industrial and trade policies
                      in shaping the process of structural change and economic development.</p>

                    <p>One of the most significant results of the qualitative literature on national systems of innovation (NSIs)
                      is that different systemic arrangements (i.e. configurations of actors and institutions) can deliver similar
                      levels of innovative performance. Using factor analysis on a novel dataset of 29 quantitative indicators of 
                      innovative activities we provide an empirical characterization of the structure of European NSIs over the 
                      last ten years. Our results cast doubt on the empirical significance of the “equifinality” of heterogeneous 
                      systemic arrangements in the context of NSI. Innovation systems show inherent complexity, which leads to a
                      high level of complementarity among their constituent components and configuration. This result implies that
                      successful innovation policies should be systemic, leaving little flexibility in policy design and scope.</p>

                  <p>This paper argues that mixed-methods triangulation can be understood as the manifestation
