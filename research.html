                <p> Big data are increasingly used to make predictions about the value of uncertain investments, thereby helping firms identify 
                  innovation opportunities without the need for domain knowledge. This trend has raised questions about which firms will primarily 
                  benefit from the availability of these data-driven predictions. Contrary to existing research suggesting that data-driven 
                  predictions level the playing field for firms lacking domain knowledge, I argue — using a simple theoretical framework — that these 
                  predictions reinforce the competitive advantage of firms with domain knowledge. In high-stakes contexts like innovation, where 
                  returns are skewed and only a few leads can be pursued, domain knowledge helps evaluate predictions and avoid false positives. 
                  I test this idea using novel data on the pharmaceutical industry, exploiting the features of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
                  that provide data-driven predictions about new drug targets. The results show that GWAS stimulate corporate investments in 
                  innovation, yet around one-third of these efforts are misallocated toward false positive predictions. Companies lacking domain 
                  knowledge react more strongly but are disproportionally likely to fall into the trap of false positives. Instead, domain knowledge 
                  helps firms pursue fewer alternatives that are more likely to be the best opportunities. Together, the results show that even if 
                  data-driven predictions are valuable in innovation, domain knowledge remains a crucial source of competitive advantage in the 
                  age of big data technologies.</p>

                <p>How does big data change the search for innovation? Data-driven predictions can identify promising technological combinations even when 
                  their underlying mechanisms are unknown. This has raised concerns that decoupling innovation from theoretical understanding weakens 
                  incentives to develop new theory and results in discoveries whose consequences are poorly understood. Using an evolutionary framework 
                  of variation and selection, I argue that data technologies can, instead, reinforce theory generation. Data-driven search broadens the 
                  space of combinations explored and increases the variability in outcomes compared to theory-driven approaches. As a result, this search 
                  strategy uncovers more surprising findings that stimulate, rather than substitute, new theorizing. I test these ideas in the domain of 
                  human genetics, where genome-wide association studies (GWAS) represent a data-driven search for the genetic roots of disease. Compared 
                  to traditional theory-based approaches, GWAS introduce gene-disease combinations that span a wider portion of the genetic landscape, 
                  more frequently fall at both extremes of scientific quality, and often defy expectations from existing knowledge. Rather than crowding 
                  out theory, GWAS findings trigger a surge of follow-on work aimed at elucidating their causal mechanisms. Together, the results reveal a 
                  complementarity between theory and data in search, suggesting that big data technologies can fuel virtuous cycles of theorizing sparked 
                  by empirical anomalies.</p>

                <p> Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as powerful tools for management and organizational research. While early applications have centered on data processing and the 
                  replication of survey-based studies, their potential for theory building remains largely untapped. In this paper, we show how AI can support theory development by simulating 
                  experiments using LLMs as synthetic subjects. We begin by introducing a structured framework to standardize the design and execution of in silico experiments with LLM-powered 
                  agents. Although not without limitations, we argue that this approach blends the realism of human-subject data with the computational control of agent-based models. We apply 
                  the framework to the classic exploration–exploitation dilemma in strategy, showing that LLM simulations can reproduce “ground truth” results from human participants. We 
                  then demonstrate how LLM agents can be used to generate new hypotheses, investigate mechanisms, and test boundary conditions. We conclude by discussing the promise and limitations
                  of this methodological innovation, and how it can complement existing approaches while opening new avenues for management research.

                <p>This study examines the impact of access to confidential administrative data on the rate, direction, and policy relevance of economics research.
                  To study this question, we exploit the progressive geographic expansion of the U.S. Census Bureau's Federal Statistical Research Data Centers 
                  (FSRDCs). FSRDCs boost data diffusion, help empirical researchers publish more articles in top outlets, and increase citation-weighted 
                  publications. Besides direct data usage, spillovers to non-adopters also drive this effect. Further, citations to exposed researchers 
                  in policy documents increase significantly. Our findings underscore the importance of data access for scientific progress and evidence-based

                <p>We study exploration under uncertainty and show how access to data on past attempts can paradoxically hinder breakthrough discovery.
                  We develop a model of the ``streetlight effect'' demonstrating that when data highlights attractive but ultimately suboptimal 
                  projects, it can narrow exploration and suppress innovation. In a laboratory experiment, we find that revealing the value of an 
                  enticing project lowers payoffs and reduces breakthrough discoveries. This drop stems from increased free-riding behavior, which 
                  crowds out the generation of new data. We then apply our theory in the context of scientific research into the genetic origins of 
                  human diseases, focusing on the drivers of limited exploration. To identify the causal impact of past data, we use an instrumental 
                  variable that leverages exogenous genetic overlaps between humans and laboratory mice, which reduces research costs for specific 
                  genes and leads to prioritized data collection about them. We find that diseases with early evidence of promising genetic targets 
                  are 16 percentage points less likely to yield breakthroughs than those where early efforts failed. While competition attenuates the 
                  streetlight effect, it does not eliminate it. Our paper provides the first analysis of this phenomenon, outlining the conditions 
                  under which data leads agents to look under the lamppost rather than engage in socially beneficial exploration.</p>

                <p>Organizational experience is often scarce, making the ability to enrich it through generalization a central feature of 
                  learning. However, the consequences of learning in this way remain poorly understood. How does generalization shape the 
                  balance between omission and commission errors, and which organizations rely on it more? We develop a computational model 
                  that shows how generalization makes learning more efficient by spreading feedback across related alternatives, but this 
                  efficiency comes at the cost of increased omission errors. The model further predicts that the optimal degree of generalization
                  depends on the nature of the firm's prior experience. We test these predictions using data on clinical trial failures. 
                  Consistent with the model, pharmaceutical firms reduce investment in biologically related drug targets, with the most 
                  significant declines occurring for proximate high-merit targets. The effects are larger for firms with more limited or 
                  concentrated experience, suggesting that generalization is an imperfect yet useful substitute for direct knowledge. These 
                  findings highlight both the promise and the pitfalls of generalization in settings where experience is limited.</p>

                <p>We develop a model of how a principal motivates innovation by contracting researchers to generate ideas that improve economic productivity. 
                  Because individual effort is unobservable, the principal relies on career incentives tied to peer recognition, measured through citations to a 
                  scientist's publications. However, citations reward not only societal value but also reflect the number of researchers working on a given topic. 
                  As a result, researchers may inefficiently over-coordinate their efforts. This can give rise to “academic bubbles" in which researchers continue 
                  working in areas with little prospect of advancing knowledge. We empirically analyze the selection of topics in research on the genetic 
                  determinants of human disease. Consistent with the model, we document that crowding on a narrow set of topics inflates citation impact, 
                  with patterns that point to career concerns as a driver of misallocated scientific effort.</p>

                <p>Why do firms invest in basic science when they could rely on published academic research? We argue that one overlooked reason 
                  is the uncertain reliability of science itself. When basic science is required for product development, corporate control of 
                  the research process serves as a substitute for the low verifiability of findings produced externally. Firms retain in-house 
                  research capabilities to assess, produce, and validate the studies needed for their innovations, particularly in domains where 
                  science is less dependable. We investigate this argument in the context of Alzheimer’s preclinical research, where inappropriate 
                  image alterations provide an objective marker of unreliable data. Using an AI-based detection tool validated through manual review,
                  we scan the entire field and document a rising trend of data issues in published science. Problematic cases are less frequent 
                  when firms lead academic-industry collaborations and are nearly absent in fully corporate-authored research. In domains where

                <p>The study of innovation depends heavily on high-quality patent data. Yet, datasets containing complete patent documents 
                  focus only on recent decades, while historical patent datasets with broader temporal coverage typically lack detailed 
                  information. Therefore, our ability to leverage advances in textual analyses to study long-run innovation dynamics remains 
                  limited. To this end, we introduce a large-scale dataset of the universe of technical specifications of British patents
                  granted between 1617–1899. Our data consists of the full specification texts alongside linked information about inventors,
                  including their disambiguated names, occupations, and addresses. We use our data to document changes over time in total 
                  inventive activity, the geography of innovation, inventor occupations, and patent novelty and impact. Finally, we discuss use
                  cases and avenues for subsequent research.</p>

                <p>Microdata from government agencies is believed to be valuable for economics research, and yet access to this data is highly 
                  restricted due to concerns about privacy and security. We provide an empirical assessment of the use and impact of 
                  restricted-access data that researchers can analyze at the U.S. Census Bureau's secure facilities. Our findings show 
                  that the use of Census Bureau's confidential data is growing and the publications employing it have a higher impact on 
                  the scientific and policy debate. However, adoption remains largely limited to established researchers from prestigious 
                  institutions. Our results and discussion inform the design of policies that balance privacy protection with accessibility

                    <p>The distinction between macro- and microinventions is at the core of recent debates on the Industrial Revolution. 
                      Yet, the empirical testing of this notion has remained elusive. We address this issue by introducing a new quality 
                      indicator for all patents granted in England in the period 1700–1850. The indicator provides the opportunity for a 
                      large-scale empirical appraisal of macro- and microinventions. Our findings indicate that macroinventions did not 
                      exhibit any specific time-clustering, while microinventions were characterized by clustering behavior. In addition, 
                      we also find that macroinventions displayed a labor-saving bias and were mostly introduced by professional engineers.
                      These results suggest that Allen’s and Mokyr’s views of macroinventions, rather than conflicting, should be 
                      regarded as complementary.</p>

                    <p>In this chapter we discuss the role of natural resources and endowment structures on structural
                      change. Departing from theories of trade that stress specialization according to one’s comparative
                      advantages as the key route to development, we articulate an alternative point of view on the
                      role of technological learning and absolute advantages for structural transformation. Ricardian
                      adjustment processes relying on endowment-based comparative advantages are often times a misleading 
                      driver of development; rather, technological competitiveness offers a better criterion to achieve sustained 
                      economic well-being. This theoretical perspective provides useful guidance to interpret the effects
                      of globalization and the role of natural resources relative to industrial and trade policies
                      in shaping the process of structural change and economic development.</p>

                    <p>One of the most significant results of the qualitative literature on national systems of innovation (NSIs)
                      is that different systemic arrangements (i.e. configurations of actors and institutions) can deliver similar
                      levels of innovative performance. Using factor analysis on a novel dataset of 29 quantitative indicators of 
                      innovative activities we provide an empirical characterization of the structure of European NSIs over the 
                      last ten years. Our results cast doubt on the empirical significance of the “equifinality” of heterogeneous 
                      systemic arrangements in the context of NSI. Innovation systems show inherent complexity, which leads to a
                      high level of complementarity among their constituent components and configuration. This result implies that
                      successful innovation policies should be systemic, leaving little flexibility in policy design and scope.</p>
