                <p> Big data are increasingly used to make predictions about uncertain investments, thereby helping firms identify innovation opportunities 
                  without the need for domain knowledge. This trend has led to questions about which firms will primarily benefit from the availability of 
                  these data-driven predictions. Contrary to existing research suggesting that data-driven predictions level the playing field for firms 
                  lacking domain knowledge, I argue—using a simple theoretical framework—that these predictions actually reinforce the competitive 
                  advantage of firms with domain knowledge. In innovation contexts, where returns are skewed and not all leads can be pursued, domain knowledge 
                  helps evaluate predictions and avoid false positives. I test this idea in the context of pharmaceutical innovation, 
                  exploiting the features of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) that provide data-driven predictions about new drug targets. The results
                  show that GWASs stimulate corporate investments, but around one-third of these resources are misallocated toward false positive predictions. 
                  Companies lacking domain knowledge react more strongly but are disproportionally likely to fall into the trap of false positives. Instead,
                  domain knowledge helps firms make fewer investments that target only the best opportunities. Together, the results show that even if 
                  data-driven predictions hold value when searching for innovations, domain knowledge remains the crucial source of competitive advantage 
                  in the age of big data.</p>

                <summary>Abstract</summary>
                <p>In many settings, innovation involves searching for new combinations in technological spaces defined by mapping efforts. Recent advances 
                  in search technologies allow for the collection of large quantities of data to inform exploration decisions in such cases. This method of 
                  data-driven recombinant search starkly contrasts with traditional approaches that rely solely on theoretical understandings to identify 
                  breakthroughs. In this paper, I conduct an empirical case study to provide the first investigation of how data can change recombinant search 
                  in well-defined landscapes. I study this emergent phenomenon in the context of human genetics, where the advent of genome-wide association studies
                  (GWASs) has enabled a form of data-driven search for the genetic roots of diseases divorced from theoretical considerations. By comparing 
                  gene-disease combinations introduced by GWASs with those from theory-driven studies, I provide unique evidence of how the search process shapes
                  innovation outcomes. My results show that discoveries introduced by GWASs span a wider portion of the genetic landscape, are more likely to 
                  involve neglected human genes, and are of higher scientific value than comparable combinations introduced by theory-driven studies. However, 
                  heterogeneity analyses reveal that data-driven search performs poorly with interdependent components because correlational data neglect complex
                  interactions that only a theoretical understanding can capture. This paper contributes to exploring the boundary conditions of data-driven search
                  and generates questions for future research on how data shape innovation.</p>

                <p>This study examines the impact of access to confidential administrative data on the rate, direction, and policy relevance of economics research.
                  To study this question, we exploit the progressive geographic expansion of the U.S. Census Bureau's Federal Statistical Research Data Centers 
                  (FSRDCs). FSRDCs boost data diffusion, help empirical researchers publish more articles in top outlets, and increase citation-weighted 
                  publications. Besides direct data usage, spillovers to non-adopters also drive this effect. Further, citations to exposed researchers 
                  in policy documents increase significantly. Our findings underscore the importance of data access for scientific progress and evidence-based 
                  policy formulation.</p>

                <p>We consider settings such as innovation-oriented R&D and entrepreneurship where agents must explore across different
                  projects with varying but uncertain payoffs. How does providing partial data on project payoffs affect individual 
                  performance and social welfare? While data can typically reduce uncertainty and improve welfare, we present a simple 
                  theoretical framework where data provision can decrease group and individual payoffs. We predict that when data
                  shines a light on sufficiently attractive (but not optimal) projects, it can crowd-out exploration activity, lowering
                  individual and group payoffs as compared to when no data is provided. We test our theory in an online lab experiment 
                  and show that data provision on the true value of one project can hurt individual payoffs by 12% and reduce the group's
                  likelihood of discovering the optimal outcome by 48%. Our results provide a theoretical and empirical examination of 
                  the streetlight effect, outlining the conditions under which data leads agents to look under the lamppost rather than 
                  engage in socially beneficial exploration.</p>

                    <p>The distinction between macro- and microinventions is at the core of recent debates on the Industrial Revolution. 
                      Yet, the empirical testing of this notion has remained elusive. We address this issue by introducing a new quality 
                      indicator for all patents granted in England in the period 1700–1850. The indicator provides the opportunity for a 
                      large-scale empirical appraisal of macro- and microinventions. Our findings indicate that macroinventions did not 
                      exhibit any specific time-clustering, while microinventions were characterized by clustering behavior. In addition, 
                      we also find that macroinventions displayed a labor-saving bias and were mostly introduced by professional engineers.
                      These results suggest that Allen’s and Mokyr’s views of macroinventions, rather than conflicting, should be 
                      regarded as complementary.</p>

                    <p>In this chapter we discuss the role of natural resources and endowment structures on structural
                      change. Departing from theories of trade that stress specialization according to one’s comparative
                      advantages as the key route to development, we articulate an alternative point of view on the
                      role of technological learning and absolute advantages for structural transformation. Ricardian
                      adjustment processes relying on endowment-based comparative advantages are often times a misleading 
                      driver of development; rather, technological competitiveness offers a better criterion to achieve sustained 
                      economic well-being. This theoretical perspective provides useful guidance to interpret the effects
                      of globalization and the role of natural resources relative to industrial and trade policies
                      in shaping the process of structural change and economic development.</p>

                    <p>One of the most significant results of the qualitative literature on national systems of innovation (NSIs)
                      is that different systemic arrangements (i.e. configurations of actors and institutions) can deliver similar
                      levels of innovative performance. Using factor analysis on a novel dataset of 29 quantitative indicators of 
                      innovative activities we provide an empirical characterization of the structure of European NSIs over the 
                      last ten years. Our results cast doubt on the empirical significance of the “equifinality” of heterogeneous 
                      systemic arrangements in the context of NSI. Innovation systems show inherent complexity, which leads to a
                      high level of complementarity among their constituent components and configuration. This result implies that
                      successful innovation policies should be systemic, leaving little flexibility in policy design and scope.</p>

                  <p>This paper argues that mixed-methods triangulation can be understood as the manifestation 
                    of retroduction, the logic of inference espoused by critical realism. As such, it can provide 
                    the basis upon which different insights upon the same phenomenon can be sensibly combined and 
                    thus has the potential to unite aspects of different traditions of economic and social thought. 
                    In this regard, the paper supports Lawson's view that the exclusive insistence on mathematical 
                    and statistical modelling in economics is misguided. The paper explores how disciplinary 
                    boundaries may be broken down and interdisciplinary social science, of which economics 
                    can be a part, established.</p>
